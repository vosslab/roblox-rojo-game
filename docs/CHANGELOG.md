# Changelog

## 2025-12-20
- Refactor server and client code into modular services with clear entry points.
- Add shared constants for remotes, tags, and instance names.
- Preserve playground geometry fixes and quest/economy behavior under the new structure.
- Fix playground geometry: slide ramp slopes down from the platform, swing height is reachable, and path blocks have gaps.
- Rebuild merry-go-round base as an octagon with an invisible quest target part.
- Align sand, swing area, and merry-go-round to the ground surface for clean visuals.
- Add Selene and StyLua configs, a TestEZ vendor drop, and a Lune test runner.
- Add starter QuestService unit tests and a testing guide.
- Add `docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md` with the repo layout and generated asset notes.
- Add a Playground bootstrap failsafe to rebuild world geometry if the main entrypoint fails.
- Add a merry-go-round spin prompt and server-driven spin control via E push.
- Add a visible spin marker and rotate the merry-go-round around the base center for clearer motion debugging.
- Refactor merry-go-round control into `World/Interactables/MerryGoRound.lua` to keep quest logic focused on progression.
- Remove stale playground caching for quest lookups and add rotation debug prints with SpinMarker position checks.
- Add safe requires in Main, fix ClientMain UI module requires, and make SaveService safe at require-time.
- Add Shared/Util and Shared/Types plus Dev diagnostics modules with Studio-only loading.
- Gate merry-go-round debug prints behind a debug flag, soften the spin marker, and tune spin impulse/friction.
- Add Slide interactable to apply a gentle sliding impulse and WalkSpeed boost on the slide ramp.
- Add `tests/run-lua-tests.sh` as a bash helper for running Lune/TestEZ tests.
- Add `Brewfile` and document `brew bundle` for installing dev tooling.
- Make `tests.luau` path joining self-contained for older Lune versions.
- Add `INSTALL.md` and move `brew bundle` guidance there.
- Move `INSTALL.md` into `docs/INSTALL.md`.
- Expand `README.md` with purpose, quick start, and documentation links.
- Make `tests.luau` robust to Lune versions that do not expose `roblox.game`.
- Add `tests/run-selene.sh` and `tests/run-stylua.sh` for linting/formatting scripts.
- Rename `tests/run-lua-tests.sh` to `tests/run-lune-tests.sh`.
- Exclude TestEZ from Selene, allow undefined test globals, and fix Lune TestEZ require.
- Add `tests/run-lua-tests.sh` as a compatibility shim for the renamed test runner.
- Exclude __tests__ from Selene and use roblox.require in Lune tests.
- Set global require for Lune tests, reduce Selene warnings, and clean unused helpers/UDim2 patterns.
- Make slide impulses follow the ramp slope and require pressing E to activate sliding.
- Enlarge the sandbox, add a fenced perimeter with a spawn opening, auto-slide down the ramp, and add merry-go-round poles.
- Resize the fence to a smaller sandbox area and speed up slide impulses.
- Expand the sand patch, place the fence on its edge with a gate facing the spawn, and increase slide speed.
- Fix fence gate orientation lookup to use HomeSpawn instead of a missing spawn reference.
- Ensure tycoon world instances (HouseModel, CoinSpawners, UpgradePad) are built to avoid Init waits.
- Make swing interactable accept the SwingTopBar name to avoid missing-top-beam warnings.
- Add a simple ladder to the slide for climbing back up.
- Refactor world geometry into per-object builders under `World/Builders/` with `WorldBuilder` as orchestrator.
- Document the world builder/interactable modular pattern in `docs/ROBLOX_LUA_STYLE.md`.
- Remove an unused RunService require from Swing interactable.
- Clean up old slide geometry (unexpected parts/trusses) during slide build.
- Remove any leftover slide truss parts under the playground to eliminate the blocking platform.
- Remove any leftover LadderTopStep parts from the slide ladder build.
- Silence repeated DataStore warnings in Studio by skipping DataStore calls unless published.
- Move swing push/impulse logic into `World/Interactables/Swing.lua`.
- Replace the Lune runner with a filesystem-based `tests/run.luau` smoke test entrypoint.
- Fix `tests/run_all_tests.sh` to resolve helper scripts relative to its own location.
- Add labeled output to `tests/run_all_tests.sh` for each test step.
